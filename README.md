# OIBSIP
This project completely consists of 3 tasks in total 
Tasks are as follows:
1.Iris Flower Classification
2.Sales Price Prediction
3.Car Price Prediction
    
IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION
Iris flower has three species; setosa, versicolor, and virginica, which differs according to their
measurements. Now assume that you have the measurements of the iris flowers according to
their species, and here your task is to train a machine learning model that can learn from the
measurements of the iris species and classify them.

SALES PRICE PREDICTION
Sales prediction means predicting how much of a product people will buy based on factors
such as the amount you spend to advertise your product, the segment of people you
advertise for, or the platform you are advertising on about your product.

CAR PRICE PREDICTION
The price of a car depends on a lot of factors like the goodwill of the brand of the car,
features of the car, horsepower and the mileage it gives and many more. Car price
prediction is one of the major research areas in machine learning. So if you want to learn
how to train a car price prediction model then this project is for you.
